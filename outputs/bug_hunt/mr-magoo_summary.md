# Mr. Magoo Experiential User Testing Summary

## Agent: Mr. Magoo
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Method:** Navigated the website as a non-technical Tribal staff member. Read HTML structure and CSS styling only -- no source code inspected.

## Overall Impression

This is a well-built, respectful tool. The search works beautifully with fuzzy matching and alias hints. The download process is clear. The mobile experience is good. The visual design communicates professionalism and trust. I would confidently recommend this to a colleague at another Tribal Nation.

**Trust Score: 8/10**

## Key Findings

### MAGOO-003 (Cosmetic): Document type descriptions missing
The "Internal Strategy" and "Congressional Overview" buttons do not explain what each document contains. A user has to guess which one they need.

### MAGOO-007 (Cosmetic): No visible privacy/sovereignty statement
There is no indication that searches are private, no cookies are set, and no tracking occurs. A simple footer note would build trust.

### MAGOO-009 (Cosmetic): No shareable links
Selecting a Tribe does not change the URL. Users cannot share a direct link to a specific Tribe's card with colleagues.

## What Works Well

- Fuzzy search is forgiving and intuitive (MAGOO-002)
- Performance is excellent -- everything is instant (MAGOO-005)
- Mobile layout is well thought out with proper touch targets (MAGOO-008)
- State filter is a good alternative navigation path (MAGOO-010)
- Visual design is professional and respectful (MAGOO-011)
- Council-ready presentation (MAGOO-012)

## Recommendation

A Tribal staff member between meetings on a Tuesday afternoon could successfully find their Tribe, download the right document, and share it with their team in under 30 seconds. That is the standard this tool should meet, and it does.

**Oh my, delightful! This one works rather well, I must say.**
