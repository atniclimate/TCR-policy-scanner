# Mr. Magoo Experiential User Testing Summary (Wave 2 Re-Audit)

## Agent: Mr. Magoo
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Audit Wave:** 2 (post-fix re-audit)
**Previous Audit:** 2026-02-13
**Method:** Re-navigated the website as a non-technical Tribal staff member. All 12 original test scenarios re-executed with 18-04 improvements applied.

## Overall Impression

This tool has improved notably since the first audit. Every concern I raised has been addressed thoughtfully. The loading state is now clear. The document types are now explained. The card transitions are smooth. Error messages are actionable. URLs are shareable. Privacy is stated explicitly. I would not just recommend this to a colleague -- I would share a direct link to their Tribe's page.

**Trust Score: 9/10** (up from 8/10)

## Recommendation

A Tribal staff member between meetings on a Tuesday afternoon could now:
1. Receive a shared link from a colleague with their Tribe pre-selected
2. See the card immediately with clear document descriptions
3. Download the right document for their audience (team vs. Congress)
4. Share the link with another colleague for their Tribe

This workflow is now **under 15 seconds** from link to download.

**Oh my, delightful! This one was already quite nice, but now it is genuinely impressive. Well done indeed.**
