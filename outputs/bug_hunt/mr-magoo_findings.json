NOW: When I land on the page, there is a prominent animated spinner with 'Loading Tribe data...' text below it. The spinner is centered and visible. I immediately understand the page is loading. The search box is still grayed out (which is correct -- it should not accept input until data is ready), but the spinner makes the wait obvious and expected.",
      "what_i_expected": "A clear loading indicator.",
      "how_i_got_here": "Opened the page for the first time.",
