      "what_happened": "When I first land on the page, the search box says 'Start typing a Tribe name...' but it is grayed out. There is a brief moment where I think the page is broken because I cannot type. Then the loading message disappears and the search box becomes active. But for a second or two, it feels like nothing is working.",
      "what_i_expected": "I expected the search box to be immediately available, or at least a clear loading indicator that explains why I need to wait.",
      "how_i_got_here": "Opened the page for the first time.",
      "how_it_felt": "Slightly confusing. The 'Loading Tribe data...' text is small and easy to miss. I noticed the disabled search box first.",

      "severity": "cosmetic",
      "category": "friction",
      "what_happened": "I searched for 'Navaho' (common misspelling of Navajo). The search found the Navajo Nation correctly through fuzzy matching. I also tried 'Standing Rock' and found 'Standing Rock Sioux Tribe'. Partial searches like 'Syc' found 'Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation'. The fuzzy search works well.",
      "what_i_expected": "That misspellings would still find the right Tribe.",
      "how_i_got_here": "Typed in the search box.",
      "how_it_felt": "Pleasantly surprised. The search is forgiving and helpful. The 'Also known as' hint is a nice touch when searching by an alias name.",

      "what_happened": "After selecting a Tribe, I see two download buttons: 'Internal Strategy' and 'Congressional Overview'. I am not sure what the difference is. Which one should I download? What is an 'Internal Strategy' vs a 'Congressional Overview'? There is no explanation.",
      "what_i_expected": "A brief description of what each document contains, or at least a tooltip explaining the difference.",
      "how_i_got_here": "Selected a Tribe from the search results. The card appeared with download buttons.",
      "how_it_felt": "Slightly uncertain. I would probably download both just to be safe, but I should not have to guess what I am getting.",
      "suggestion": "Add a one-line description under each button or a small 'What is this?' link. For example: 'Internal Strategy: Detailed analysis with talking points for your team' and 'Congressional Overview: Facts-only briefing for congressional offices'.",

The previous Tribe's card stayed visible while I was searching for the new one, which was briefly confusing -- I was not sure if I was looking at the old result or a new one.",
      "what_i_expected": "When I start a new search, the previous Tribe card should disappear or be clearly replaced.",
      "how_i_got_here": "Downloaded a document, then wanted to search for a different Tribe.",
      "how_it_felt": "Minor friction. Once I selected the new Tribe, the card updated correctly. The brief moment of overlap was disorienting.",
      "suggestion": "Consider hiding the Tribe card when the user starts typing in the search box again. Or add a visual transition that clearly shows the card is updating.",

      "how_i_got_here": "Used the entire application from start to finish.",

There is no mention of how my data is handled, whether my search is tracked, or what happens to the information I access. The footer just says 'Tribal Climate Resilience Program' with no additional context.",

      "how_it_felt": "Neutral. I trust the site because it looks professional, but an explicit privacy statement would increase confidence.",
      "suggestion": "Add a one-line data sovereignty note in the footer: 'No tracking. No cookies. Your searches stay on your device.' This would immediately build trust with Tribal staff who are concerned about data privacy.",

      "how_it_felt": "Slightly disappointing. If I found the right Tribe for my colleague, I would need to tell them the name and have them search it themselves.",
      "suggestion": "Consider adding hash-based URLs (e.g., #tribe=Navajo+Nation) so that selecting a Tribe updates the URL and the page can restore that selection from the URL on load. This is a nice-to-have, not essential.",

  "overall_impression": "This is a well-built, respectful tool. The search works beautifully with fuzzy matching and alias hints. The download process is clear. The mobile experience is good. The visual design communicates professionalism and trust. The few issues I found are minor polish items: loading state clarity, document type descriptions, and the inability to share direct links to specific Tribes. I would confidently recommend this to a colleague at another Tribal Nation.",
