      "abstract": "We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove Geocarpon minimum from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. Our review indicates that the threats to Geocarpon minimum have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, we propose to delist Geocarpon minimum. This proposed rule completes the 5-year status review for the species. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 4 and 7, would no longer apply to Geocarpon minimum.",

      "abstract": "In this action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is rescinding the Administrator's 2009 findings of contribution and endangerment and repealing all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to effectuate the best reading of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 202(a)(1). The EPA determines that CAA section 202(a)(1) does not authorize the Agency to prescribe emission standards in response to global climate change concerns for multiple reasons, including the best reading of the statutory terms \"air pollution,\" \"cause,\" \"contribute,\" and \"reasonably be anticipated to endanger.\" This statutory interpretation is corroborated by application of the major questions doctrine. The EPA further determines that GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines do not impact in any material way the public health and welfare concerns identified in the Administrator's prior findings in 2009. On these multiple and independent bases, the EPA concludes that it lacks statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions in response to global climate change concerns under CAA section 202(a)(1), and is not finalizing the additional bases for repeal set out in the proposed rule.",

These proposed amendments seek to improve chemical process safety by avoiding duplicative requirements, realigning RMP requirements with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, and eliminating unnecessary burdens placed on facilities where there is not specific data available to show that the current RMP standards would reduce or have reduced the number of accidental releases.",

Specifically, this final rule limits eligibility for non-domiciled Commercial Learner's Permits (CLPs) and Commercial Driver's Licenses (CDLs) for foreign-domiciled individuals to those who hold specific, verifiable employment-based nonimmigrant status. This rule reaffirms the IFR requirements, aligning the issuance of non- domiciled CDLs with FMCSA's statutory mandate to ensure the fitness of all drivers who operate a CMV. By limiting eligibility to statuses subject to enhanced consular vetting of driver history and interagency screening, FMCSA restores the integrity of the CDL system, closes a significant safety gap, and enhances the safety of the traveling public.",

The units are individually named Pioneer Unit 1 and Pioneer Unit 2. In addition, the NRC is providing notice that an uncontested hearing will be held on SMR's application at a time and place to be set in the future by the presiding officer for the uncontested hearing. This notice also provides the public with an opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene (i.e., contested hearing) with respect to that application. If the NRC issues an LWA, the applicant, SMR, would be authorized to conduct certain early construction activities of a dual-unit SMR-300 plant at the PEC site. Because the application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), this notice includes an order that imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation.",

This notice of intent (NOI) serves to announce the scoping process BOEM will use to identify significant issues and potential alternatives for consideration in the California Oil and Gas PEIS. On November 20, 2025, DOI published the first of three proposals during the development of the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program (11th National Program). The Secretary's Draft Proposed Program for the 11th National Program includes one proposed lease sale in the Northern California Program Area, two proposed lease sales in the Central California Program Area, and three proposed lease sales in the Southern California Program Area. Because the first California lease sale is tentatively scheduled to occur near the beginning of the 11th National Program and given the long lead time needed to prepare for a proposed sale, BOEM must initiate the lease sale planning process and prepare the PEIS simultaneously with the development of the 11th National Program.",

      "abstract": "The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act included a provision requiring each State that receives funding under the National Highway Freight Program (NHFP) to develop a State Freight Plan (the Plan) that provides a comprehensive approach for the immediate and long-range planning activities and investments of the State with respect to freight, and meets all the required plan contents listed in the Act. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) added several new required elements and updated procedures for State Freight Plans. This guidance document updates and replaces the prior guidance on State Freight Plans and State Freight Advisory Committees issued on January 12, 2023. It also updates the guidance to be consistent with recent Executive Orders issued by President Trump and DOT Orders issued by Secretary Duffy. Except for any requirements specified in the statutes cited in the guidance document, the contents of this guidance document do not have the force and effect of law and do not bind the public in any way. The contents will not be relied upon by the Department as a separate basis for affirmative enforcement action or other administrative penalty. Conformity with any recommendations in this guidance document, as distinct from statutory requirements, is voluntary only, and nonconformity will not affect rights and obligations under existing statutes.",

Specifically, the EPA is repealing the revised filterable particulate matter (fPM) emission standard, which serves as a surrogate for non-mercury hazardous air pollutant (HAP) metals for existing coal- fired EGUs; the revised fPM emission standard compliance demonstration requirements; and the revised mercury (Hg) emission standard for lignite-fired EGUs.

The certification label or marking provides motor carriers purchasing new trailers or new impact guards to replace damaged devices with a means to determine whether the equipment is certified as meeting the FMVSS. However, the labeling or marking requirement has proven problematic for motor carriers when the label or marking becomes illegible or wears off during the service life of the trailer or guard. This final rule eliminates an unintended regulatory burden on motor carriers without compromising safety, as it does not affect the applicable FMVSS. The final rule also rescinds a guidance document pertaining to illegible, incomplete, or missing rear impact guard certification labels.",

Hawaii's SIP submission is intended to address the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility, including regional haze, in mandatory Class I Federal areas. The SIP submission also addresses other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program. The EPA is proposing to approve the portions of Hawaii's submission relating to calculations of baseline, current, and natural visibility conditions, progress to date, the uniform rate of progress, reasonably attributable visibility impairment, progress report requirements, and monitoring strategy and other implementation plan requirements. The EPA is proposing to disapprove the long-term strategy, including the enforceable shutdown of several electric generating units at facilities on the islands of Hawaii and Maui.
