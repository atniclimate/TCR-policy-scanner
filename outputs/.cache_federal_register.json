      "abstract": "In this action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is rescinding the Administrator's 2009 findings of contribution and endangerment and repealing all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to effectuate the best reading of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 202(a)(1). The EPA determines that CAA section 202(a)(1) does not authorize the Agency to prescribe emission standards in response to global climate change concerns for multiple reasons, including the best reading of the statutory terms \"air pollution,\" \"cause,\" \"contribute,\" and \"reasonably be anticipated to endanger.\" This statutory interpretation is corroborated by application of the major questions doctrine. The EPA further determines that GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines do not impact in any material way the public health and welfare concerns identified in the Administrator's prior findings in 2009. On these multiple and independent bases, the EPA concludes that it lacks statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions in response to global climate change concerns under CAA section 202(a)(1), and is not finalizing the additional bases for repeal set out in the proposed rule.",

The magnitude of unprecedented and destructive wildfires and other threats to forest health over the last decade, approaches to management (including the barred owl management), and severely reduced timber production compared to historically higher levels (and its resulting adverse economic consequences) merit consideration in an RMP revision. This notice announces the beginning of the scoping period to solicit public comments and identify issues, provide planning criteria for public review, and seek comment on current and future land use designations in the planning areas.

DOE has determined that revisions to the PEF are necessary. DOE is first publishing a final rule that removes the fuel content factor (FCF) from the calculation of the PEF. Removal of the FCF is consistent with a United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit decision that held, among other things, that the inclusion of the FCF in the PEF calculation exceeded DOE's authority under the substantive statute.

The certification label or marking provides motor carriers purchasing new trailers or new impact guards to replace damaged devices with a means to determine whether the equipment is certified as meeting the FMVSS. However, the labeling or marking requirement has proven problematic for motor carriers when the label or marking becomes illegible or wears off during the service life of the trailer or guard. This final rule eliminates an unintended regulatory burden on motor carriers without compromising safety, as it does not affect the applicable FMVSS. The final rule also rescinds a guidance document pertaining to illegible, incomplete, or missing rear impact guard certification labels.",

Hawaii's SIP submission is intended to address the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility, including regional haze, in mandatory Class I Federal areas. The SIP submission also addresses other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program. The EPA is proposing to approve the portions of Hawaii's submission relating to calculations of baseline, current, and natural visibility conditions, progress to date, the uniform rate of progress, reasonably attributable visibility impairment, progress report requirements, and monitoring strategy and other implementation plan requirements. The EPA is proposing to disapprove the long-term strategy, including the enforceable shutdown of several electric generating units at facilities on the islands of Hawaii and Maui. Additionally, we are proposing to disapprove the portions of the submission relating to reasonable progress goals and FLM consultation requirements.",

Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. The final rule authorizes agencies to move policy-influencing positions into Schedule Policy/Career. These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals. This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.

This LMP was submitted on October 15, 2024 by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). The plan addresses the second ten-year maintenance period for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers, known as PM<INF>2.5</INF>. The EPA is proposing approval of New York's LMP submission because it provides for the maintenance of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS through the end of the second ten-year portion of the maintenance period. In addition, the EPA completed the adequacy review process of this New York PM<INF>2.5</INF> LMP for transportation conformity purposes on September 4, 2025.",
