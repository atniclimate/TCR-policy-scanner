### FLAGGED — Requires Specialist Attention

**FEMA BRIC** (CI: 12%)

> FEMA announced termination of BRIC on April 4, 2025. FY24/25 cycles canceled. ~$882M unobligated IIJA funds being returned to Treasury. Requires immediate specialist engagement.
>
> **Specialist Focus:** Advocacy must pivot to the replacement mechanism. Ensure Tribal set-asides are baked into the new 'responsive mitigation approach' from day one. Protect existing fully obligated projects.
