<objective>
Produce the final SYNTHESIS.md report reflecting the post-remediation system state, then present to the user for the definitive go/no-go launch decision.

This replaces the Wave 3 synthesis (18-03) with updated numbers reflecting all P2/P3 fixes and re-audit results.

  <name>Task 1: Produce updated SYNTHESIS.md</name>
  <files>outputs/bug_hunt/SYNTHESIS.md</files>
  <action>
Read all 4 updated agent findings JSON files (post-remediation). Rewrite `outputs/bug_hunt/SYNTHESIS.md` with the same structure as the original but with updated numbers.

Use the same section structure as the current SYNTHESIS.md (which was produced in 18-03). Key changes:
- Updated severity counts reflecting P2/P3 fixes
- Updated per-agent summaries from re-audit
- New "Remediation Wave" section documenting what was fixed in 18-04
- Updated trust score and joy score from re-audit
- Updated go/no-go recommendation
- New quality certificate with final numbers

**Important accuracy requirements:**
- Count actual findings from the updated JSON files, not estimates
- Trust score from Mr. Magoo's updated findings
- Joy score from Marie Kondo's updated findings
- Sovereignty assessment from Dale Gribble's updated findings
- Use encoding="utf-8" when writing

  <what-built>
Updated production hardening synthesis report at `outputs/bug_hunt/SYNTHESIS.md` reflecting the complete P2/P3 remediation cycle:

- Wave 1 (18-01): Pre-flight fixes + 4-agent adversarial audit
- Wave 2 (18-02): P0/P1 fix cycle
- Wave 3 (18-03): Initial synthesis (NO-GO, user chose to fix P2/P3)
- Wave 4 (18-04): P2/P3 remediation (19 fixes across UX, security, code hygiene)
- Wave 5 (18-05): 4-agent re-audit validating all fixes
- Wave 6 (18-06): This final synthesis

The report includes updated severity counts, improved trust/sovereignty assessments, and a final go/no-go recommendation.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Read `outputs/bug_hunt/SYNTHESIS.md` -- review the updated report
2. Check severity counts -- how many P2/P3 remain after remediation?
3. Check trust score -- did Mr. Magoo's assessment improve?
4. Check sovereignty assessment -- still compliant?
5. Check for any new findings from the re-audit
6. Review the final go/no-go recommendation

**Decision:** Is the TCR Policy Scanner ready for production launch?

Options:
- **GO**: Launch. P2/P3 remediation complete, all agents confirmed clean.
- **CONDITIONAL GO**: Launch with specific monitoring caveats.
- **NO-GO**: Additional work needed. Specify concerns.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "go", "conditional go", or "no-go" with any additional instructions</resume-signal>
</task>

<verification>
1. SYNTHESIS.md updated with post-remediation numbers
2. Go/no-go recommendation is evidence-based
3. Human has reviewed and rendered final launch decision
4. All test suites pass
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Updated synthesis accurately reflects the remediated system state
- Human has all information needed for final launch decision
- Phase 18 can be closed after this plan
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion (including human decision), create `.planning/phases/18-production-hardening/18-06-SUMMARY.md`
