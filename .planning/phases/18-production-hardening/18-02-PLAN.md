<objective>
Triage all findings from the 4 adversarial agents, fix all P0 and P1 issues, apply low-risk Marie Kondo hygiene suggestions, and re-verify fixes until the system is clean.

Purpose: Wave 2 of the three-wave Phase 18 structure. This fix wave transforms audit findings into code corrections across the full system (website, pipeline, scrapers, deployment). The fix-verify loop continues until zero P0/P1 remain. Marie Kondo's low-risk suggestions (dead code, unused imports, simple cleanup) are applied during this wave if they touch <= 3 files and cannot introduce regressions.

Output:
- Fixed source files across website, pipeline, scrapers, and deployment
- Updated agent findings with verification status
- Clean test suite (964+ tests passing)

Read all 4 findings JSON files from `outputs/bug_hunt/`. Parse findings arrays and classify:

**Step 1: Build priority matrix**

Create a triage table from all 4 agents' findings:
- P0 (critical): Must fix. Blocks launch.
- P1 (important): Must fix or document workaround.
- P2 (cosmetic): Document. Fix if low-risk.
- P3 (cosmetic): Backlog.

When agents disagree on severity for the same issue, defer to the domain expert:
- Security/sovereignty -> Dale Gribble's severity wins
- Code correctness -> Cyclops's severity wins
- User experience -> Mr. Magoo's severity wins
- Code hygiene -> Marie Kondo's severity wins

**Step 2: Fix P0 issues (if any)**

For each P0 finding:
1. Read the file at the specified path and line
2. Apply the fix from the finding's `fix` field (or an equivalent correct fix)
3. Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` after each P0 fix
4. If a fix introduces a new issue, fix the regression too (fix forward)

P0 findings are typically:
- Data sovereignty violations (tracking, analytics, data leakage)
- Complete feature failures (downloads broken, search non-functional)
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, path traversal, secret exposure)

**Step 3: Fix P1 issues**

For each P1 finding:
1. Read the file at the specified path and line
2. Apply the fix
3. Run tests after each batch of related P1 fixes
4. If a P1 cannot be fixed without significant refactoring, document a workaround instead

P1 findings are typically:
- WCAG AA contrast failures (should be resolved by Task 1 of 18-01)
- Download flow issues for subset of users
- Silent data loss or missing error handling on critical paths
- Race conditions that cause visible bugs

**Step 4: Apply low-risk Marie Kondo suggestions**

From Marie Kondo's findings, apply hygiene fixes that meet ALL of these criteria:
- Touches <= 3 files
- Is purely subtractive (removing dead code, unused imports) or cosmetic (reformatting)
- Cannot change runtime behavior
- Does not modify public interfaces or function signatures
- Verified as truly unused (not "might be used later")

Examples of safe Marie Kondo fixes:
- Remove unused Python imports (`import os` when os is never used)
- Remove dead functions that nothing calls
- Remove resolved TODO/FIXME comments
- Clean up unused config keys
- Remove unused CSS classes (verified not referenced)

Examples to SKIP:
- Refactoring that changes interfaces (even if "cleaner")
- Removing code that looks unused but might be called dynamically
- Consolidating modules (too many files touched, high risk)
- Removing dependencies from requirements.txt (could break deployment)

Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` after applying Marie Kondo fixes.

**Step 5: Re-verify fixes**

For each P0/P1 finding that was fixed:
1. Re-read the code section to confirm the fix is applied
2. Verify the fix addresses the specific issue described in the finding
3. Check that surrounding code still makes sense
4. Confirm no new issues were introduced

If any P0/P1 finding cannot be fixed or verified, document why and flag for Plan 18-03 synthesis.

**Important rules:**
- Fix forward -- never revert. If a fix breaks something, fix the breakage too.
- All fixes go in the appropriate source files, never in generated output files.
- Run tests after each fix batch. Never accumulate untested changes.
- Use `encoding="utf-8"` for all Python file operations.
- Respect the project's atomic write pattern (tmp + os.replace) where already used.
- Do NOT add new tests in this plan -- test suite expansion would be a separate concern.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Zero P0 findings remain across all 4 agent findings
- Zero P1 findings remain (all fixed or have documented workarounds)
- `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` passes with zero failures
- Marie Kondo low-risk suggestions applied (unused imports, dead code removed)
- No behavioral changes introduced beyond specific defect fixes
- Each fix addresses the specific issue described in the finding
  </verify>
  <done>All P0 and P1 findings are resolved across all 4 adversarial agents, low-risk Marie Kondo hygiene applied, all tests pass, and fixes have been re-verified against original findings</done>

After all fixes from Task 1 are applied, perform a targeted re-verification of the specific checklist items that had P0/P1 findings.

**Re-verification strategy:**
- If total P0+P1 findings across all agents < 15: Targeted spot-check. Re-read only the code sections that were fixed. Verify each fix resolves the finding.
- If total P0+P1 findings >= 15: Full re-audit of affected files.

**For each fixed P0/P1 finding:**
1. Re-read the file at the line specified in the original finding
2. Confirm the code has changed from the original `code_snippet` to the fixed version
3. Verify the fix matches the `fix` recommendation (or valid alternative)
4. Check for new issues in surrounding code introduced by the fix
5. Mark the finding as "verified_fixed" in the agent's JSON

**Update findings JSON files:**
For each agent's findings JSON, add a `fix_status` field to each P0/P1 finding:
```json
{
  "id": "CYCLOPS-001",
  "severity": "critical",
  "fix_status": "verified_fixed",
  "fix_applied": "description of what was changed",
  "fix_verified_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}
```

For P2/P3 findings, add `fix_status: "deferred"` or `fix_status: "applied"` (for Marie Kondo items).

**If re-verification reveals new P0/P1 issues:**
Fix them immediately (fix forward). Update the findings JSON with the new finding and its fix. Loop until clean -- no P0/P1 remaining.

**Final test run:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```
Record total test count for Plan 18-03 synthesis.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Every P0/P1 finding across all 4 agents has `fix_status: "verified_fixed"`
- No new P0/P1 findings discovered during re-verification
- All findings JSONs updated with fix_status fields
- `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` passes
- Total test count recorded for synthesis report
  </verify>
  <done>All P0/P1 fixes verified clean. No new P0/P1 issues found during re-verification. Agent findings JSONs updated with fix_status. Test suite passes completely.</done>
