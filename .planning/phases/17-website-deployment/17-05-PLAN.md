<objective>
Run 4 parallel review agents against the completed website, aggregate findings into a priority matrix, and produce a synthesis document identifying cross-agent themes and an implementation roadmap for any fixes needed.

Purpose: WEB-10 requires a formal review synthesis. The 4 agents (Web Wizard, Mind Reader, Keen Kerner, Pipeline Professor) each examine the website from their specialty perspective. The synthesis document enables prioritized remediation if Phase 18 discovers issues.

Output: `outputs/website_review/SYNTHESIS.md` with priority matrix, cross-agent themes, and implementation roadmap.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run 4-agent website review and produce SYNTHESIS.md</name>
  <files>outputs/website_review/SYNTHESIS.md</files>
  <action>
Create `outputs/website_review/` directory. Then systematically review the completed website from 4 agent perspectives:

**Agent 1: Web Wizard** (Performance + Build + SquareSpace)
Review `docs/web/` for:
- Bundle size analysis (sum all JS + CSS + HTML + expected tribes.json gzipped)
- Verify total is under 500KB gzipped target
- Check for render-blocking resources (CSS in head is fine for small file)
- CLS risk: dynamic content insertion patterns
- LCP considerations: largest contentful paint element
- SquareSpace iframe compatibility: sandbox permissions documented, download attribute works same-origin
- GitHub Pages configuration: 404.html SPA routing, relative path resolution
- No external CDN requests (XCUT-02)

**Agent 2: Mind Reader** (UX/UI + Accessibility + WCAG 2.1 AA)
Review `docs/web/index.html` + `docs/web/js/combobox.js` for:
- ARIA combobox: role="combobox" on input, aria-controls, aria-expanded, aria-autocomplete="list", aria-activedescendant
- Keyboard navigation: ArrowDown/Up/Enter/Escape handlers
- Focus management: DOM focus stays on input, visual focus via aria-activedescendant
- Screen reader announcements: live region for result count
- Color contrast: check all foreground/background combinations against 4.5:1
- Focus indicators: visible focus styles on all interactive elements
- prefers-reduced-motion: all transitions and CRT effect disabled
- Landmark roles: banner, main, contentinfo
- Form labels: all inputs have associated labels

**Agent 3: Keen Kerner** (Typography + Type Scale + Readability)
Review `docs/web/css/style.css` for:
- CSS custom property type scale (--tcr-fs-xs through --tcr-fs-xl)
- Letter-spacing: 0.06em on titles (not 0.15em)
- Line-height: 1.5 body, 1.2 headings
- Line length: max-width on text containers (45-75 characters)
- Font stack: system fonts, no external font loading
- Dark mode typography: contrast ratios maintained in dark palette
- Heading hierarchy: h1 > h2 > h3, no skipped levels

**Agent 4: Pipeline Professor** (Data Pipeline + Deployment + Integration)
Review `.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml` + `generate-packets.yml` + `scripts/build_web_index.py` for:
- tribes.json generation includes aliases and generated_at timestamps
- DOCX file copy to correct subdirectory structure
- manifest.json generation with deployment timestamp
- Git commit automation
- Workflow triggers appropriate for continuous deployment
- Data freshness: generated_at timestamps enable badge calculation
- Error handling: graceful degradation when files missing

**Produce `outputs/website_review/SYNTHESIS.md` with this structure:**

```markdown
# Website Review Synthesis

## Overview
Phase 17 website review by 4 agents. Findings aggregated by priority.

## Priority Matrix

### P0 - Critical (blocks launch)
{List any P0 findings, or "None identified"}

### P1 - High (must fix before launch)
{List P1 findings with agent source, file, and fix recommendation}

### P2 - Medium (fix post-launch)
{List P2 findings}

### P3 - Low (nice to have)
{List P3 findings}

## Cross-Agent Themes
{Where 2+ agents flag the same concern, note the convergence}

## Agent Summaries

### Web Wizard: Performance & Compatibility
{Summary of performance findings}

### Mind Reader: Accessibility & UX
{Summary of WCAG findings}

### Keen Kerner: Typography & Readability
{Summary of typography findings}

### Pipeline Professor: Data & Deployment
{Summary of pipeline findings}

## Implementation Roadmap
{Ordered list of fixes if any P0/P1 found, with estimated effort}

## Quality Certificate
Status: {PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL}
P0 count: {N}
P1 count: {N}
Phase 18 cleared: {Yes / No / Conditional}
```

Be thorough but realistic. This is a vanilla HTML/JS/CSS site under 50KB gzipped -- it's inherently fast. Focus findings on real issues, not theoretical concerns.

SYNTHESIS.md produced with 4-agent review findings aggregated into priority matrix, cross-agent themes identified, and quality certificate issued. Phase 18 clearance status determined.

  <what-built>Complete website: search with fuzzy matching across 592 Tribes, state filter, DOCX downloads, dark mode, CRT effect, ARIA accessibility, mobile responsive, GitHub Pages deployment pipeline, and 4-agent review synthesis.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open `docs/web/index.html` in a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8080 -d docs/web`)
2. Type "navjo" (misspelling) -- should find Navajo Nation
3. Use ArrowDown/Up to navigate results, Enter to select
4. Verify card shows with freshness badge and download buttons
5. Select a state from dropdown -- verify browse list appears
6. Toggle OS dark mode -- verify site switches colors
7. Check `outputs/website_review/SYNTHESIS.md` for review findings
8. Review any P0/P1 issues flagged
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to complete Phase 17, or describe any issues to address.</resume-signal>

1. `outputs/website_review/SYNTHESIS.md` exists with complete 4-agent review
2. Priority matrix categorizes all findings as P0/P1/P2/P3
3. Cross-agent themes identified
4. Quality certificate issued
5. Website functionally tested: search, filter, download, dark mode, mobile

<success_criteria>
- All 4 review agents produced findings from their specialty perspective
- SYNTHESIS.md aggregates findings into priority matrix
- Zero P0 critical issues (or they are documented for immediate fix)
- Quality certificate is PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS
- Human verification confirms website works end-to-end
