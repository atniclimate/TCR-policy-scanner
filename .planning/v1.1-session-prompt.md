# v1.1 Session Prompt: Meeting Prep Packets

**Copy everything below the line into a fresh Claude Code session.**
**Working directory: F:\tcr-policy-scanner**

---

## Context

I have a working TCR (Tribal Climate Resilience) Policy Scanner at `F:\tcr-policy-scanner`. The v1 milestone is complete — 4 phases, 9 plans, 30/30 requirements, 52 tests passing, 3 code review passes applied. The scanner runs daily via GitHub Actions, scanning 4 federal APIs (Federal Register, Grants.gov, Congress.gov, USASpending), scoring relevance against 16 tracked climate resilience programs, running 5 monitors (IIJA sunset, reconciliation, DHS funding cliff, Tribal consultation, Hot Sheets sync), classifying programs into advocacy goals via a 5-rule decision engine, and outputting a 14-section advocacy intelligence briefing (`outputs/LATEST-BRIEFING.md`) and structured JSON (`outputs/LATEST-RESULTS.json`).

**The problem:** The scanner produces excellent intelligence, but it's trapped in a GitHub repo. Tribal leaders preparing for advocacy events (policy conventions, advocacy sessions, ECWS, congressional meetings, Tribal consultations) need this intelligence packaged as **meeting prep packets** — formatted, event-specific, Tribe-aware documents they can carry into a room and use.

## What I Want to Build (v1.1 Milestone)

**Meeting Prep Packet Generator** — a feature that produces event-specific advocacy intelligence packets from the scanner's existing data pipeline. This is the "last mile" that turns raw policy intelligence into an advocacy product Tribal leaders actually use.

### Core Concept

Before a specific event (ECWS 2026, a policy convention, a congressional delegation visit, a Tribal consultation session), the scanner generates a focused packet containing:

1. **Per-program briefs** (target: 1-2 pages each) for programs relevant to that event's agenda
2. **"Since last meeting" change summary** — what shifted since the previous event packet was generated
3. **Advocacy goal + talking points template** per program — auto-generated from decision engine output, with placeholders for human strategic framing
4. **Tribe-specific framing** — which specific Tribes are impacted by which programs, where climate impacts are most pronounced, where funding is most needed or at risk

### Key Design Questions That Need Answering

The `/gsd:new-milestone` interview phase should deeply explore these:

**Output format and delivery:**
- What file format? Markdown (easy to generate) vs. PDF (easy to print/share) vs. Word/DOCX (easy to edit before distribution)?
- Should it produce one monolithic packet or individual per-program briefs that can be assembled?
- Print-optimized layout? (Many advocacy meetings still use paper handouts)
- Should the packet include a 1-page executive summary / "cheat sheet" for quick reference?

**Event configuration:**
- How does the user specify which event they're generating for? CLI flag? Config file? Interactive prompt?
- How are "relevant programs" filtered per event? By agenda topic? By attending Tribes? By funding category? Manual selection?
- Should there be event templates (policy convention, advocacy session, ECWS, Congressional, Tribal Consultation) with pre-configured program selections?
- How often are packets generated? Once before each event? Updated daily leading up to an event?

**"Since last meeting" tracking:**
- How do we know when the last meeting was? Stored in a config/state file?
- What counts as a "change"? CI status shift, new legislative threat, funding amount change, new grant opportunity, advocacy goal reclassification?
- Should this be a diff summary or a narrative? ("Since the 2025 mid-year advocacy event, IRS Elective Pay has shifted from STABLE to AT_RISK due to reconciliation bill H.R. XXXX targeting Section 6417")

**Talking points and advocacy framing:**
- What's the line between auto-generated content and human-authored content?
- Can the decision engine's advocacy goal (e.g., "Protect Base") generate a template talking point? ("Program X provides $Y in funding for Z Tribal communities. Current threat: [threat]. Recommended action: [action]")
- Should talking points reference specific legislation by bill number and title?
- Are there standard advocacy "frames" from Tribal advocacy organizations that should be templated? (e.g., trust responsibility framing, sovereignty framing, climate justice framing)

**Tribe-specific framing (this is the hardest and most valuable part):**
- The current scanner tracks 16 federal programs. Can we map which Tribes or regions are most impacted by each program?
- Sources for Tribe-program mapping: USASpending obligation data (already scraped), Grants.gov award data, BIA service area data
- Climate impact data: FEMA National Risk Index, EPA EJScreen, Tribal climate adaptation plans (are these T0/public data?)
- "Pronounced climate impacts" — can we identify Tribes facing acute wildfire, flooding, drought, sea level rise, or permafrost thaw based on public data?
- Privacy/sensitivity: This is T0 (Open) data only. No internal Tribal data. Only public federal records about federal programs.
- Could a Tribal leader look up their specific Tribe/region and see: "Programs relevant to you: [list], Current threats: [list], Funding at risk: $X, Recommended advocacy: [goal]"

**Relationship to existing Hot Sheets:**
- Tribal advocacy organizations produce "Hot Sheets" — per-program advocacy summaries used at conventions (like the FY26 Climate Program Hot Sheets for ECWS 2026)
- The prep packet should complement (not replace) the Hot Sheets
- Possible relationship: scanner generates the facts layer (scores, statuses, threats, countdowns), Hot Sheets author adds strategy layer (talking points, political context, recommendations)
- Could the prep packet BE a draft Hot Sheets that a policy analyst reviews and edits before distribution?

**Automation boundary:**
- What runs automatically (daily scan data)? vs. What requires human trigger (generate packet for specific event)?
- Should the scanner auto-detect upcoming events from a calendar/config and pre-generate packets?
- Review workflow: who reviews the packet before distribution? Is there a "draft → review → final" pipeline?

### Technical Constraints

- **T0 (Open) classification**: All data must come from public federal sources. No Tribal-specific sensitive data.
- **Existing stack**: Python 3.12, aiohttp, jinja2. The report generator already uses string building; jinja2 is available for templates.
- **Existing data pipeline**: The scanner already produces scored items, monitor alerts, decision engine classifications, CI history, and graph data. The prep packet generator consumes this — it does NOT re-scan.
- **Dual workspace**: Development on Windows (F:\tcr-policy-scanner), deployment via GitHub Actions (Linux). Both must work.
- **GitHub Actions**: Could add a `generate-packet.yml` workflow triggered manually with event parameters.

### Reference Files to Read

Before starting the interview phase, read these files to understand the existing system:

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — project overview, core value, constraints
- `.planning/STATE.md` — current architecture notes (monitors, decision engine, report sections)
- `.planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` — what was built, tech debt
- `src/reports/generator.py` — current report generation (14 sections)
- `src/analysis/decision_engine.py` — advocacy goal classification
- `src/monitors/__init__.py` — monitor framework
- `config/scanner_config.json` — configuration structure
- `data/program_inventory.json` — the 16 tracked programs
- `outputs/LATEST-BRIEFING.md` — current briefing output (see what's already there)

### What Success Looks Like

After v1.1, a Tribal policy analyst preparing for ECWS 2026 can run:

```
python src/main.py --prep-packet --event ecws-2026
```

And receive a formatted packet containing:
- Executive cheat sheet (1 page)
- Per-program briefs for climate resilience programs on the ECWS agenda
- Change summary since last advocacy event
- Advocacy goals with talking point templates
- Tribe-relevant context where public data supports it

The packet is ready to review, edit for political context, and distribute to Tribal leaders attending the event.

## How to Start

Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to begin the v1.1 milestone cycle. This will:
1. **Interview phase** — deep questioning about the prep packet requirements (spend time here — this is where the product gets defined)
2. **Research phase** — investigate available public data sources for Tribe-specific framing, output format options, template engines
3. **Requirements definition** — formalize what v1.1 must deliver
4. **Roadmap creation** — phase and plan breakdown

The interview phase is the most important part. The questions above are starting points — follow the user's domain expertise about what Tribal leaders actually need in advocacy meetings.
