- [x] **GRAPH-02**: ADVANCES edge type connects Structural Asks to program nodes
- [x] **GRAPH-03**: 10 new statutory authorities from Strategic Framework added to graph_schema.json
- [x] **GRAPH-04**: 6 new barriers from Strategic Framework added to graph_schema.json
- [x] **GRAPH-05**: Trust Super-Node (FEDERAL_TRUST_RESPONSIBILITY) implemented with TRUST_OBLIGATION edges to BIA/EPA programs

### Monitoring Capabilities
