**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-14
**Phases:** 15-18
**Total Plans:** 20
**Git range:** `8f96850` -> `e8a4aba`
**Commits:** 76
**Changes:** 134 files changed, +28,202 / -3,302 lines
**Timeline:** 2026-02-12 -> 2026-02-14 (3 days)

## Overview

Ship a production-ready website delivering real DOCX advocacy packets to 592 Tribal Nations, backed by reliable scrapers, congressional intelligence, and trustworthy document quality. Target: 100-200 concurrent users over 48-hour launch window.

**Depth:** Quick (4 phases)
**Requirements:** 39 across 5 categories (INTEL, DOCX, WEB, HARD, XCUT)
**Architecture:** 4-phase agent swarm pipeline -- each phase uses parallel agents with defined territories

**Critical path:** Congressional intelligence pipeline (Phase 15) --> Document quality assurance (Phase 16) --> Website deployment (Phase 17) --> Production hardening (Phase 18)

## Phases

### Phase 15: Congressional Intelligence Pipeline

**Goal**: Tribal Leaders receive advocacy packets enriched with complete congressional intelligence -- bill tracking, delegation data, committee activity, and confidence-scored sections -- backed by scrapers that paginate to completion with zero silent data loss

**Depends on**: Phase 14 (v1.2 shipped)

**Requirements**: INTEL-01 through INTEL-15, XCUT-01, XCUT-02, XCUT-03

**Agent Swarm:** Sovereignty Scout, Fire Keeper, River Runner, Horizon Walker

**Plans:** 7 plans in 4 waves

- [x] 15-01: Data model contract: Pydantic models, context extension, confidence scoring, KG schema (Wave 1, Fire Keeper)
- [x] 15-02: Scraper pagination hardening: all 4 scrapers paginate to completion (Wave 1, Sovereignty Scout)
- [x] 15-03: Documentation: alert system spec, integration map, KG spec, data roadmap (Wave 1, Horizon Walker)
- [x] 15-04: Bill detail fetcher + bill-to-program mapping + config (Wave 2, Sovereignty Scout)
- [x] 15-05: DOCX renderers + orchestrator wiring + regional sections (Wave 3, Fire Keeper)
- [x] 15-06: Test suite: models, pagination, confidence, rendering (Wave 4, River Runner)
- [x] 15-07: E2E test + CI pipeline + XCUT compliance verification (Wave 4, River Runner)

---

### Phase 16: Document Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Every document in the 992-document corpus is structurally valid, content-accurate, and pipeline-verified -- confirmed by 5 independent audit agents whose findings are machine-readable and traceable to specific quality dimensions

**Depends on**: Phase 15 (congressional content must exist before auditing documents)

**Requirements**: DOCX-01 through DOCX-06

**Agent Swarm:** 5 parallel READ-ONLY audit agents (Design Aficionado, Accuracy Agent, Pipeline Surgeon, Gatekeeper, Gap Finder)

**Plans:** 2 plans in 2 waves

- [x] 16-01: Wave 1 Audit: structural validation script + 5 parallel audit agents (DOCX-01 through DOCX-06)
- [x] 16-02: Wave 2 Fix + Verify: fix P0/P1 defects, add critical tests, re-validate, produce SYNTHESIS.md quality certificate

---

### Phase 17: Website Deployment

**Goal**: Any of 592 Tribal Nations can visit the website, search for their Nation by name (with typo tolerance), and download real DOCX advocacy packets -- served from GitHub Pages, embeddable in SquareSpace, accessible via keyboard and screen reader, and performant on mobile devices

**Depends on**: Phase 16 (verified DOCX must exist before website distributes them)

**Requirements**: WEB-01 through WEB-10

**Agent Swarm:** 4 parallel review agents (Web Wizard, Mind Reader, Keen Kerner, Pipeline Professor)

**Stack:** Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS + Fuse.js 7.1.0 (self-hosted, SRI-verified)

**Plans:** 5 plans in 3 waves

- [x] 17-01: Data pipeline: build_web_index.py alias embedding + Fuse.js self-hosting (Wave 1)
- [x] 17-02: HTML + CSS: ARIA combobox markup, dark mode, CRT effect, type scale, mobile (Wave 1)
- [x] 17-03: JavaScript: ARIA combobox + Fuse.js search + state filter + card rendering (Wave 2)
- [x] 17-04: Deployment: deploy-website.yml + generate-packets.yml update + manifest (Wave 2)
- [x] 17-05: Review: 4-agent website review synthesis + human verification (Wave 3)

---

### Phase 18: Production Hardening

**Goal**: The complete system -- scrapers, documents, website, and deployment -- passes a 4-agent adversarial review with zero P0 critical issues, confirming it is ready for 100-200 concurrent Tribal users during a 48-hour launch window

**Depends on**: Phase 17 (deployed website must exist before adversarial testing)

**Requirements**: HARD-01 through HARD-05

**Agent Swarm:** 4 bug hunt agents (Cyclops, Dale Gribble, Mr. Magoo, Marie Kondo)

**Plans:** 6 plans in 6 waves

- [x] 18-01: Pre-flight fixes (inherited P1/P2/P3) + 4-agent adversarial audit (Wave 1)
- [x] 18-02: Fix P0/P1 findings + apply low-risk Marie Kondo hygiene + re-verify (Wave 2)
- [x] 18-03: Initial synthesis report + human go/no-go checkpoint (Wave 3) -- NO-GO, fix P2/P3
- [x] 18-04: Fix all actionable P2/P3 findings: UX, security, code hygiene (Wave 4)
- [x] 18-05: 4-agent re-audit validating P2/P3 fixes (Wave 5)
- [x] 18-06: Updated synthesis + final go/no-go launch decision (Wave 6)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| DEC-1501-01 | Legislator model kept lightweight | Don't duplicate CongressionalDelegate for renderers |
| DEC-1501-02 | Confidence decay_rate=0.01 (~69-day half-life) | Congressional data freshness matters |
| DEC-1502-01 | Grants.gov uses startRecordNum offset | API-specific pagination pattern |
| DEC-1502-02 | USASpending limit=100 with full pagination | Upgraded from default page size |
| DEC-1502-03 | Safety caps vary by scraper | 2500/1000/1000/5000 tuned per source |
| DEC-1504-01 | Bill relevance: 4 weighted components | subject 0.30, CFDA 0.25, committee 0.20, keyword 0.25 |
| DEC-1504-02 | Two-phase relevance scoring | Quick title scan then full detail |
| DEC-1504-03 | Voting records deferred | Senate.gov lacks structured data |
| DEC-1505-01 | Bills-first ordering in DOCX | Position 4 before delegation |
| DEC-1505-02 | Doc B relevance threshold 0.5 | Higher bar for congressional-facing docs |
| DEC-1601-01 | Performance budget relaxed to 210s | python-docx parsing ~200ms/file inherent |
| DEC-1602-01 | Amber badge #B45309 | WCAG 4.6:1 contrast fix |
| DEC-1602-02 | Quality gate default=True | Changed from bypass-by-default |
| DEC-1702-01 | Listbox calc(100%-2rem) width | Accounts for search container padding |
| DEC-1802-01 | Accept manifest.json exposure | T0 data, GitHub Pages inherently public |
| DEC-1803-01 | NO-GO on initial synthesis | User chose to fix all P2/P3 before launch |
| DEC-1804-01 | Safe DOM methods for errors | No innerHTML, XSS prevention |
| DEC-1804-02 | All 14 CFDAs in grants_gov | Via shared cfda_map.py |
| DEC-1804-03 | GitHub Actions SHA-pinned | Supply chain protection |
| DEC-1805-01 | Accept 2 new P3 findings | CYCLOPS-016, DALE-019 documented |
| DEC-1806-01 | GO for production launch | Trust 9/10, Joy 9/10, 0 P0/P1/P2 |

**Issues Resolved:**

- Congress.gov bill detail fetching (5 sub-endpoints per bill)
- Scraper pagination for all 4 sources (zero silent truncation)
- DOCX audience leakage (Doc B/D air gap enforcement)
- WCAG contrast failures (amber badge, button styles)
- Quality gate bypass default (changed to enabled)
- 38 adversarial findings fixed across 2 audit rounds

**Issues Deferred:**

- VoteNode data structure (Senate.gov lacks structured vote data)
- Voting records integration (no programmatic Senate source)
- CYCLOPS-016: URIError on malformed hash fragment (P3, console-only)
- DALE-019: daily-scan.yml uses version tags not SHA pins (P3)
- 3 dark mode WCAG contrast failures (P1, CSS-only fix)
- 16 P2 document quality improvements
- 29 P3 minor polish items

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- 48 total items (0 P0, 3 P1 deferred, 16 P2, 29 P3)
- See `v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` for complete inventory
- Dark mode contrast fixes are CSS-only (no architectural impact)
