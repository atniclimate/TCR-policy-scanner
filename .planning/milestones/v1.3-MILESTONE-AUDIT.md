## Cross-Phase Integration

**Checked by:** gsd-integration-checker agent
**Status:** PASS (1 P3 documentation gap)

### Connected Integrations: 23/23

All cross-phase exports consumed. No orphaned exports. No circular dependencies.

| From | To | Link | Status |
|------|----|------|--------|
| Phase 15 | Phase 16 | Congressional DOCX content → quality audit | WIRED |
| Phase 16 | Phase 17 | SYNTHESIS.md PASS gate → website deployment | WIRED |
| Phase 17 | Phase 18 | Website review findings → pre-flight fixes | WIRED |
| Phase 15 | Phase 17 | Tribal registry + aliases → build_web_index.py | WIRED |
| Phase 15 | Phase 18 | Scraper pagination → Cyclops data path traces | WIRED |
| Phase 16 | Phase 18 | Quality patterns → P2/P3 remediation | WIRED |

### E2E Flows: 5/5 Complete

1. **Scraper → DOCX → Download**: Congress.gov API → congressional_intel.json → PacketOrchestrator → DocxEngine → GitHub Pages → user download
2. **Quality Pipeline**: 5 audit agents → findings JSON → P1 fixes → SYNTHESIS PASS → Phase 17 cleared
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: daily-scan.yml → generate-packets.yml → deploy-website.yml → GitHub Pages
4. **User Journey**: Visit → search (fuzzy) → Tribe card → download DOCX → open in Word
5. **Adversarial Validation**: Phase 17 review → Phase 18 pre-flight → 4-agent audit → remediation → re-audit → GO

### Integration Gap

**GAP-INT-01 (P3):** Structural validator doesn't check congressional section content quality. Functionally covered by test_e2e_congressional.py (19 tests). Documentation-only gap.

## Tech Debt Inventory

### By Phase

**Phase 16: Document Quality Assurance (34 items)**
- 16 P2 moderate issues (quality/polish improvements)
- 18 P3 minor issues (cosmetic/pedantic)
- All documented in `outputs/docx_review/SYNTHESIS.md` lines 96-141

**Phase 17: Website Deployment (3 items)**
- P1: Dark mode button contrast (#5dade2 + white = 2.46:1, needs 4.5:1)
- P1: Dark mode badge contrast (2.19-3.82:1, needs 4.5:1)
- P1: Dark mode selected option contrast (#85c1e9 + white = 1.94:1, needs 4.5:1)
- Root cause: CSS @media block sets variables but no component-specific overrides
- Fix: CSS-only changes, no architectural impact

**Phase 18: Production Hardening (11 items)**
- 2 new P3 from re-audit (CYCLOPS-016, DALE-019) — edge cases, no user impact
- 9 deferred P3 improvement opportunities (low priority)
- All documented in `outputs/bug_hunt/SYNTHESIS.md`
