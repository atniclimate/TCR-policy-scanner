# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-09
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

The TCR Policy Scanner is a brownfield Python project with working scrapers, scoring, graph building, and report generation. This roadmap validated the existing pipeline first, then enriched the data model, added monitoring and decision logic capabilities, and finally enhanced report output to surface all new intelligence. Each phase built on the previous -- you cannot monitor what you have not modeled, and you cannot report what you have not monitored.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Pipeline Validation

**Goal**: The existing pipeline runs end-to-end against live federal APIs and produces correct output on schedule.
**Depends on**: None (foundation -- verify before building on top)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Fix Grants.gov endpoint, validate all 4 scrapers, full pipeline run, change detection
- [x] 01-02: Verify GitHub Actions CI workflow via manual trigger

**Details:**
- Requirements: PIPE-01, PIPE-02, PIPE-03, PIPE-04
- Fixed 3 scraper API bugs (Grants.gov search2 endpoint, Federal Register agency slug format, USASpending fields param)
- Validated all 4 scrapers against live APIs: Federal Register (93 items), Grants.gov (83 items), USASpending (103 items), Congress.gov (graceful skip without key)
- Full pipeline: 279 raw -> 164 scored -> 182 graph nodes, 196 edges
- CI run 21827823631 completed successfully on Ubuntu runner
- Completed: 2026-02-09

### Phase 2: Data Model and Graph Enhancements

**Goal**: The knowledge graph and program inventory reflect the full Strategic Framework -- all programs scored, statuses aligned to Hot Sheets, Five Structural Asks modeled, and expanded authorities/barriers captured.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Add TERMINATED status tier, reconciliation keywords, BIA TCR Awards CFDA
- [x] 02-02: Five Structural Asks loading, Trust Super-Node, ADVANCES/TRUST_OBLIGATION edges

**Details:**
- Requirements: DATA-01 through DATA-05, GRAPH-01 through GRAPH-05
- 7-tier CI threshold model (SECURE, STABLE, STABLE_BUT_VULNERABLE, AT_RISK, UNCERTAIN, FLAGGED, TERMINATED)
- 5 AdvocacyLeverNodes for Five Structural Asks with 26 ADVANCES edges and 9 MITIGATED_BY edges
- TrustSuperNode (FEDERAL_TRUST_RESPONSIBILITY) with 5 TRUST_OBLIGATION edges to BIA/EPA programs
- Graph: 79 static nodes, 118 edges
- Completed: 2026-02-09

### Phase 3: Monitoring Capabilities and Decision Logic

**Goal**: The scanner detects legislative threats (IIJA sunsets, reconciliation bills, funding cliffs), Tribal consultation signals, and classifies each program into an advocacy goal using 5 decision rules.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Monitor framework + threat monitors (IIJA sunset, reconciliation, DHS funding cliff)
- [x] 03-02: Advocacy decision engine with 5 classification rules (TDD)
- [x] 03-03: Signal monitors (Tribal consultation, Hot Sheets) + pipeline integration

**Details:**
- Requirements: MON-01 through MON-05, LOGIC-01 through LOGIC-05
- BaseMonitor ABC, MonitorAlert dataclass, MonitorRunner orchestrator
- 5 active monitors: HotSheetsValidator (runs first), IIJASunsetMonitor, ReconciliationMonitor, DHSFundingCliffMonitor, TribalConsultationMonitor
- DecisionEngine with 6 advocacy goals in priority order: URGENT_STABILIZATION > RESTORE_REPLACE > PROTECT_BASE > DIRECT_ACCESS_PARITY > EXPAND_STRENGTHEN > MONITOR_ENGAGE
- 52 TDD tests (45 decision engine + 7 additional), all passing
- THREATENS edge protocol: ephemeral edges regenerated each scan
- Completed: 2026-02-09

### Phase 4: Report Enhancements

**Goal**: LATEST-BRIEFING.md delivers a complete advocacy intelligence product with Five Structural Asks, Hot Sheets alignment, sunset countdowns, CI trends, reconciliation watch, and advocacy goals.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Briefing sections and indicators (Five Structural Asks, Hot Sheets sync, IIJA countdown, Reconciliation Watch, advocacy goals)
- [x] 04-02: Historical CI trend tracking and trend visualization in briefing

**Details:**
- Requirements: RPT-01 through RPT-06
- 14-section briefing: Executive Summary, Reconciliation Watch, IIJA Countdown, New Developments, Critical Updates, CI Dashboard (w/ Hot Sheets), FLAGGED, Advocacy Goals, Structural Asks, Barriers, Authorities, Advocacy Levers, CI Score Trends, All Items
- Always-render pattern for Reconciliation Watch and IIJA Countdown
- CI history persistence with 90-entry cap and timestamp dedup
- Completed: 2026-02-09

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Pipeline validates before building (brownfield project -- confirm existing pipeline works before adding features)
- Data model before monitoring (monitors need enriched graph and updated statuses)
- Reports last (reports surface monitoring/logic output)
- Grants.gov search2 API with aln parameter (API migration)
- Federal Register slug agency IDs (API format correction)
- THREATENS edges are ephemeral (regenerated each scan, not persisted)
- Rule evaluation as explicit priority list (5 rules too few for dispatch table)
- HotSheetsValidator runs first (CI overrides before decision engine)
- Always-render for threat sections ("No threats" is valuable information)
- CI history capped at 90 entries (~3 months daily scans)

**Issues Resolved:**
- 3 scraper API bugs (Grants.gov endpoint, Federal Register agency format, USASpending fields)
- OBBBA false positive filtering (enacted law exclusion + latest_action status check)
- Pass 2 domain fixes: CFDA corrections (10.691->10.720, 20.934->20.284), scoring weight rebalance, keyword additions
- Pass 3 documentation coherence: 4 docs aligned, 5 stale artifacts removed

**Issues Deferred:**
- No live scraper integration tests (v2 TEST-01 through TEST-05)
- Hardcoded FY26 dates in scanner_config.json
- No retry logic on transient API failures
- No phase VERIFICATION.md files (phases pre-date GSD verification workflow)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- CONGRESS_API_KEY required for full scans (graceful degradation without)
- PROJECT.md has minor stale counts (20 authorities listed as 21, 13 barriers listed as 14)
- ROADMAP.md header says 31/31 (actual count is 30)
