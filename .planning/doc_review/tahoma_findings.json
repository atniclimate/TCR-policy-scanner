All documents backed by real USASpending award data (451/592 Tribes), FEMA NRI hazard profiles (592/592 Tribes), and live congressional bill intelligence. Delivered via a production website (Fuse.js fuzzy search, ARIA combobox, dark mode, mobile responsive, SquareSpace embeddable) on GitHub Pages, hardened through a 2-round adversarial audit (trust 9/10, 0 P0/P1/P2 remaining, GO confirmed). 964 tests across 33 modules. Built for the Tribal Climate Resilience program, serving 592 federally recognized Tribal Nations.",
    "milestones_v1_3_entry": "## v1.3 Production Launch (Complete: 2026-02-14)\n\n**Delivered:** Congressional intelligence pipeline with bill tracking, CFDA mapping, committee activity, and confidence scoring; 5-agent document quality assurance audit with 992-document structural validation; production website with Fuse.js fuzzy search, ARIA combobox, dark mode, mobile responsive layout, and SquareSpace embedding; 4-agent adversarial hardening with 2-round audit cycle (initial NO-GO, full P2/P3 remediation, re-audit confirming GO).

Candidates: DOCX layout/presentation redesign, extreme weather vulnerability data, climate risk/impact/vulnerability assessments per Tribe.\n\n---",
    "operations_plan_retrospective": "## Retrospective (Added 2026-02-14)\n\n### Plan vs. Execution\n\nThe operations plan described a 3-phase architecture (DOCX Visual QA, Website Launch, Production Hardening). Execution was 4 phases:\n\n| Planned | Actual | Divergence |\n|---------|--------|------------|\n| Phase 1: DOCX Visual QA | Phase 15: Congressional Intelligence | Added phase -- congressional intelligence was not in the original operations plan but was the milestone's highest-value capability |\n| Phase 1 (cont.) | Phase 16: Document Quality Assurance | Roughly maps to planned Phase 1, but executed as agent swarm audit rather than Playwright visual sampling |\n| Phase 2: Website Launch | Phase 17: Website Deployment | Technology pivot: planned React 18 + Vite 6 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, shipped vanilla HTML/JS/CSS + Fuse.js |\n| Phase 3: Production Hardening | Phase 18: Production Hardening | Close match; clone pairs became single instances, but the 2-round audit exceeded the plan's single pass |\n\n### What Worked\n\n1. **Agent swarm methodology.** Parallel agents with non-overlapping territories eliminated merge conflicts and produced comprehensive coverage. The 5-agent Phase 16 audit found 40 findings across 5 quality dimensions that a single reviewer would have missed.\n2. **Written findings to disk.** Every agent writes JSON findings, and the synthesis document reconciles them. This survived context window resets perfectly -- no information lost between sessions.\n3. **NO-GO/fix/re-audit pattern.** The initial Phase 18 synthesis recommended GO, but the user elected NO-GO to fix all actionable P2/P3. This second round raised trust from 8/10 to 9/10 and resolved all P2 issues. The extra investment paid off in quality.\n4. **Checklist-driven agents.** Each bug hunter had a specific personality and checklist. Mr. Magoo (experiential) found UX issues that Cyclops (code inspector) would never notice. Marie Kondo (hygiene) found dead code that Dale Gribble (security) did not care about. Different perspectives found different bugs.\n5. **Gate decisions between phases.** Each phase had explicit success criteria that had to be verified before the next phase started. This prevented premature progression.\n\n### What Would Be Done Differently\n\n1. **Plan should have anticipated Congressional Intelligence.** The operations plan was written before requirements were finalized. Congressional intelligence was the milestone's largest phase (7 plans, 15 INTEL + 3 XCUT requirements) but appeared nowhere in the plan. Next time, finalize requirements before writing the operations plan.\n2. **Technology decision (React vs. vanilla) should have been made earlier.** The plan and requirements reference React/Vite/Tailwind, but the actual implementation used vanilla HTML/JS/CSS. This was the right call (sovereignty compliance, no build dependencies, 65KB vs hundreds of KB) but the decision should have been documented in the plan rather than discovered during execution.\n3. **Clone pairs were unnecessary.** The plan called for 2 instances of each bug hunter for coverage. In practice, single instances produced thorough coverage -- 70 findings across 4 agents was more than sufficient. The context overhead of coordinating clones would not have been worth the marginal coverage improvement.\n4. **Visual sampling (Playwright screenshots) was never needed.** The plan's Phase 1 Session 1B described Playwright-based visual inspection. The structural validation script (641 LOC, 7 automated checks) plus the 5-agent audit provided sufficient quality assurance without visual screenshots. Automated structural checks scale better than visual inspection.\n5. **Timeline estimate was close but compressed.** The plan estimated 6-8 hours across 10-12 sessions. Actual execution was approximately 3 days with more sessions but similar active time. The additional phases (congressional intelligence) and the NO-GO remediation cycle added scope not anticipated in the estimate."

It does not tell the story of a v1.3 system that shipped congressional intelligence, a production website, and passed adversarial hardening. Someone reading only PROJECT.md and MILESTONES.md would understand the scanner pipeline and DOCX generation but would miss: (1) congressional intelligence enrichment, (2) confidence scoring, (3) the production website beyond a 'search widget', (4) the agent swarm methodology, and (5) the 2-round adversarial hardening that confirmed production readiness. The institutional knowledge exists -- it is scattered across ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, phase verification reports, and synthesis documents -- but it has not been consolidated into the primary documents that a new contributor would read first. The 3 P1 findings (stale What This Is paragraph, missing MILESTONES.md v1.3 entry, stale document timestamp) mean a newcomer's first impression of the project would significantly understate its capabilities. The v1.3 milestone deserves to be honored in the documentation with the same care it received in execution."
