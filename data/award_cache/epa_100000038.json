THIS INVENTORY MUST DEFINE SERVICE LINE OWNERSHIP, AND WHERE DUAL OWNERSHIP APPLIES, MATERIALS MUST BE DEFINED ON BOTH THE PWS AND CUSTOMER PORTION OF THE LINE TO ACCURATELY PROVIDE A SINGLE CLASSIFICATION PER SERVICE LINE. THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY, GATHER, ORGANIZE, CLEAN AND CATEGORIZE THE DATA APPROPRIATELY FOR IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE 120 WATER\nPLATFORM.ACTIVITIES:PHASE 1: PROGRAM START AND CUSTOMER ALIGNMENT (1-2 WEEKS).  THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM STAGE IS FOR THE 120 WATER AND CHEROKEE NATION TEAMS TO INITIATE THE LEAD SERVICE LINE INVENTORY (LSLI) PROGRAM AND ALIGN ON PROGRAM EXPECTATIONS.\n#9679; CUSTOMER KICK-OFF MEETING: THE 120WATER TEAM WILL HOST AN INTRODUCTORY MEETING TO ESTABLISH THE CROSS-FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM TEAM AND CONFIRM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THE SESSION WILL ALSO ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM APPROACH INCLUDING SUCCESS METRICS AND PROJECT TIMELINES, AND THE CADENCE OF PROGRAM REVIEWS, CLIENT UPDATES, AND ANY ADDITIONAL CHEROKEE NATION GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS\n\nPHASE 2: DATA INVESTIGATION AND SUBMISSION (4-6 WEEKS) | THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM STAGE IS FOR THE 120 WATER TEAM TO IDENTIFY, REVIEW, DOCUMENT, AND COLLABORATIVELY UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING DATA SOURCE(S) AND SYSTEMS. \n#9679; DATA INVESTIGATION CALL WITH 120WATER LSLI LEAD PROGRAM CONSULTANT: THE 120 WATER TEAM WILL SCHEDULE A GUIDED REVIEW MEETING WITH CHEROKEE NATION TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF DATA THE 120 WATER TEAM CAN USE TO BUILD OUT A PRELIMINARY LEAD SERVICE LINE INVENTORY. COMMON DATA SOURCES INCLUDE:\n#9675; GIS RECORDS\n#9675; BILLING SYSTEM RECORDS\n#9675; WORK ORDER SYSTEM RECORD\n#9675; PAPER REPORTS, TAP CARDS, AS-BUILTS, ETC.\n\nRECENT CAPITAL PROJECTS\n#9679; DATA REQUEST: AFTER THE DATA INVESTIGATION CALL, THE LSLI LEAD PROGRAM CONSULTANT WILL SUBMIT A FORMAL DATA REQUEST TO CHEROKEE NATION. THE DATA REQUEST WILL OUTLINE THE SPECIFIC SOURCES OF DATA THE 120 WATER TEAM WILL NEED TO ANALYZE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ALL SERVICE LOCATIONS, IDENTIFY OR RULE-OUT SOURCES OF LEAD, AND PRIORITIZE AND STRATEGIZE FOR LEAD SERVICE LINE INVENTORY AND REPLACEMENT EFFORTS.\n#9679; DATA SUBMISSION: 120 WATER WILL REVIEW ALL SUBMITTED DATA SOURCES. ONCE ALL DATA IS SUBMITTED, THE 120 WATER TEAM WILL DETERMINE THE BEST ANALYSIS APPROACH TO BRING THE DATA TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE DATA SET THAT REFLECTS ALL SERVICE LINE LOCATIONS AND ASSOCIATED ATTRIBUTES.\n#9675; ESRI PARTNERSHIP SOLUTION: SINCE CHEROKEE NATION WILL WANT THE ABILITY TO VISUALIZE DATA IN ARCGIS ONLINE (AGOL), 120 WATER WILL SET UP A CHEROKEE NATION SPECIFIC AGOL ENVIRONMENT FOR DATA SUBMISSION. 120WATER WILL UPDATE THE AGOL ENVIRONMENT WITH PRELIMINARY INVENTORY FINDINGS AND CONTINUED INVENTORY UPDATES FROM THE 120 WATER PLATFORM, AS CHEROKEE NATION PROGRESSES THROUGH THEIR LEAD SERVICE LINE INVENTORY PROGRAM\n\nPHASE 3: DATA ANALYSIS (4-8 WEEKS) | THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM STAGE IS TO COMBINE ALL SUBMITTED DATA TO DEVELOP A PRELIMINARY, LOCATION-BASED LEAD SERVICE LINE INVENTORY THAT INCLUDES EPA COMPLAINT SERVICE LINE MATERIAL CATEGORIZATIONS FOR ALL IDENTIFIED SERVICE LINES. THE AIM IS TO USE EXISTING CLIENT DATA TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS, AND USE THE DATA TO RULE OUT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LEAD.\n#9679; INITIATE ANALYSIS: THE 120WATER DATA ANALYSIS TEAM WILL CONDUCT A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE SUBMITTED DATA, TO ENSURE ALL DATA FIELDS ARE UNDERSTOOD AND DATA INTEGRITY IS MAINTAINED.\n#9679; BUILD RECORDS-BASED INVENTORY: THE 120WATER DATA ANALYSIS TEAM WILL CLEAN AND COMBINE ALL APPROPRIATE DATA SOURCES INTO A SINGLE SERVICE LINE INVENTORY DATASET. THE FINAL DATASET IN THIS STAGE WILL INCLUDE SERVICE LINE LOCATIONS AND MATERIAL TYPE CATEGORIZATIONS FOR EACH IDENTIFIED SERVICE LINE IN THE DIST",
