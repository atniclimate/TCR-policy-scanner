THE ESTIMATED OUTPUT OF THE COMPLETED SYSTEM IS NEARLY 1.5 MILLION-KILOWATT-HOURS PER YEAR, OFFSETTING APPROXIMATELY 29% OF THE FACILITY’S CURRENT USAGE. ROUGHLY 92% OF THE POWER PRODUCED IS EXPECTED TO BE CONSUMED ONSITE, MAXIMIZING THE BENEFIT AT THE LOCATION RATHER THAN EXPORTING THE POWER TO THE GRID.\n\nTHE OKEMAH COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IS A 25 BED, 122,000 SQUARE FOOT COMMUNITY-FOCUSED HOSPITAL LOCATED IN OKEMAH, OKFUSKEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE MCN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THE CAMPUS CONSISTS OF THE MAIN HOSPITAL, WHICH PROVIDES EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE INCLUDING COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING, X-RAYS, LAB WORK AND OTHER IN-PATIENT SERVICES. THE ADJACENT MCN OKEMAH CLINIC PROVIDES TRADITIONAL OUTPATIENT CARE INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE, DENTAL, OPTOMETRY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING AND PHYSICAL THERAPY. THIS FACILITY CURRENTLY USES OVER FIVE MILLION KILOWATT-HOURS PER YEAR WITH A PEAK DEMAND OF OVER 800-KILOWATTS OCCURRING DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. \n\nTHE MCN AND THE MCN TRIBAL UTILITY AUTHORITY (TUA) BOTH SEEK TO EXERCISE MORE ENERGY SOVEREIGNTY AND INDEPENDENCE TO IMPROVE THE LIFE OF CITIZENS ON THE MCN RESERVATION. THIS WILL BE PARTIALLY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE INCREASED USE OF RENEWABLES TO BOTH REDUCE PURCHASED POWER COSTS AND BE BETTER STEWARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. BY HAVING THIS SOLAR PV SYSTEM IN PLACE, THE OKEMAH COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WILL SEE REAL SAVINGS THAT HELP REDUCE THE OPERATING BURDEN OF PROVIDING CRITICAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED COUNTIES IN OKLAHOMA. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE A REPLICABLE APPROACH AND SYSTEM THAT CAN BE SCALED FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT OTHER MCN FACILITIES.",
