THE SOUTHERN UTE WATER RESOURCES DIVISION- IN PARTNERSHIP WITHSOUTHERN UTE WILDLIFE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DIVISION- BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS- ANDTHE NATURE CONSERVANCY- IS PROPOSING A PROJECT TO CONSTRUCT A DIVERSION STRUCTURE TOIMPROVE RIVER CONNECTIVITY- IMPROVE FISH PASSAGE- AND ELIMINATE FISH ENTRAINMENT DURINGLOW FLOWS WHILE CONTINUING TO DIVERT NANNICE CANALS DECREED WATER. THE PROJECT INCLUDESENGINEERING AND MODIFYING A PORTION OF THE NANNICE CANAL HEADGATE STRUCTURE TOINCORPORATE A COANDA SCREEN AND FISH PASSAGE LADDER (SEE FIGURES 2 AND 3). THIS WILLALLOW FOR CONTROLLED BYPASS OF FLOWS THAT EXCEED THE DIVERSION AMOUNT DURING IRRIGATIONSEASON TO FLOW THROUGH THE STRUCTURE AND ALLOW ALL WATER TO FLOW PAST THE STRUCTURE DURINGTHE OFF-SEASON. THE PROJECTS COANDA SCREEN AND FISH LADDER DESIGN WILL IMPROVE FISHPASSAGE AND ELIMINATE FISH ENTRAINMENT EVEN DURING LOW FLOWS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ASELF-CLEANING MECHANISM IMPROVING SAFETY- MAINTENANCE- AND OPERATION OF THE DIVERSIONSTRUCTURE.",
