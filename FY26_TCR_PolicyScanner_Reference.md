## How This Document Works

This reference serves two purposes. First, it is the human-readable policy brief for Tribal leaders preparing for FY26 Congressional advocacy. Second, it provides the canonical program data that the TCR Policy Scanner uses to track federal programs relevant to Tribal climate resilience.

The document distinguishes between two categories of information. **Scenario Facts** are time-bound observations specific to the current legislative and appropriations context (the DHS expiration date, the enacted BIA TCR funding level, the BRIC termination). These facts have expiration dates and must be reassessed regularly. **Statutory Authorities** are durable legal citations (the Snyder Act, the Stafford Act Section 203, 44 CFR Section 201.7) that persist across fiscal years and anchor long-term advocacy strategies. Scenario facts require active monitoring for changes, while statutory authorities provide the legal foundation for advocacy regardless of annual program changes.

## FY26 Landscape Context

Congress enacted a consolidated FY26 funding package on February 3, 2026 that funds most agencies through September 30, 2026. DHS is funded only through February 13, 2026, creating an immediate risk window for all FEMA mitigation and preparedness functions. The Administration's FY26 discretionary request proposed reductions to climate and environmental justice programs across multiple agencies, including an explicit proposal to eliminate the BIA Tribal Climate Resilience program and a $646 million reduction to non-disaster FEMA grant programs. Congress rejected the TCR elimination and maintained core Tribal environmental capacity lines in the enacted Interior-Environment tables.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Public Law 119-21) modified federal tax credits including clean energy credits, affecting Tribal elective pay pathways. FEMA's BRIC program was terminated in April 2025, though the underlying Stafford Act Section 203 authority for pre-disaster mitigation remains active.
